### ðŸ›³ What is shipping?

Shipping code is another way to say sharing or delivering. Most people prefer to ship complete code, although incomplete code and/or projects can also be shipped. Shipping is a great way to share what you are working on with the community, and get some helpful feedback. 

### What can I ship?

You can ship anything! It could be a personal website you are working on, a cool app or game, a hackathon, the list goes on. Have something cool? Ship it!

> ðŸ—’ Shipping is mostly for code-related projects. If you want to share something not code related, I highly recommend using [scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/), a daily diary of what Hack Clubbers are learning & making every day. 

### How do I ship?

You can ship your projects on the **#ship** channel on [the hackclub slack](http://hackclub.slack.com). Not in the slack or know someone who wants to join? It's super easy to join, request an invitation [here](https://hackclub.com/community/), and you will get an email, finish registration and get in on the action!
