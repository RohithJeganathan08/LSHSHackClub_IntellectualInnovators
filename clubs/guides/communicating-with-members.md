We've gathered some examples of how leaders communicate with their clubs. Take a look!

### Remind: Lachlan Campbell (@lachlanjc)

I super recommend setting up a [Remind](https://remind.com) for your club. Itâ€™s a free service that lets anyone sign up for messages sent by you, which you can schedule. They can be either over text or email per person, so club members without cell phones can still get your messages.

My club meetings are on Monday afternoons, so I send a reminder Sunday evening, plus one during the day on Monday.

### Newsletter: Mingjie Jiang (@itsmingjie)

I believe that Hack Clubs should truly live beyond meetings. For a short while, I sent newsletters to all my club members (no matter if they showed up to the previous meeting or not). These newsletters can take a while for me to put together, but from the analytics, I do see quite a few people opening them regularly.

I think itâ€™s a great way for you to stay in touch with your club members, and potentially interest more into attending your next meeting. Hereâ€™re some examples of the emails that I sent:

I used a service called [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com), which is just a lightweight version of MailChimp.

### Google Classroom: Ethan Barker (@ohdear12)

Northshore Hacks uses Google Classroom for communication, and it's a method more and more clubs are using. It's espessally useful if your school uses GC for assignments, that way your club is right where students spend a good chunk of their day. It's good for reminders, sharing files and links, and discussions. It also has a really nice UI (It's developed by google, what did you expect) and it's easy to use.
