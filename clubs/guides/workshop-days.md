> 🗒 Please note: all the information in the guide should be viewed as what it is (a guide) and not as "you must do this." There's still some good advice in here, so it's being kept around.

Here's our suggested schedule:

- Wait for hackers to arrive (5 minutes)
- Announcements (5 minutes)
- Workshop (45 minutes)
- Free-form hacking (30 minutes)
- Next meeting reminder (5 minutes)

# Hacker Arrival

Put on a playlist and have the first slide on the projector to let people know they're in the right place.

# Workshop

This will be just like how you ran the first website workshop, except for the current workshop you're on. [Click here](https://archived.guide.hackclub.com/#/meetings/first_meeting?id=the-first-meeting) for a link to the first workshop guidelines.

# Hacking

After hackers finish the workshop, they're going to transition into free-form hacking to continue building upon what they have from the workshop. During this time, the most important thing for you to do is create an environment where people are comfortable asking for help.

When people do have questions, be eager to help them out. You want to set the example that asking for help is a good thing. It's also a good idea to turn the music back on (not too loud, people should feel comfortable talking).

# Next Meeting Reminder

Five minutes before the meeting is over, get everyone's attention to remind them about the next meeting. Say when and where it'll be and that everyone will be finishing up what they worked on today and demoing at the end of the meeting.

And thank them for coming!
